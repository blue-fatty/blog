## Problems encountered

### 2017-12-04 · Get variable's value in middle layer

**Problem description: I want to get the value of a variable in the model.**

Reference: [How can I get hidden layer representation of the given data? #41](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/41)

The simplest way is using the same code of the original model, and

1. replace the output with the variable you want
2. `new_model.set_weights(trained_model.get_weights())`
3. `new_model.predict(input_data, batch_size=32)`

Note the `batch_size` is import for large amount of samples. The `K.function()` mentioned in the [issue #41](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/41) raised `OOM exception`. Of course you can split data into batches by yourself and use the `K.function()` method, but the method showed above is more convinient for me in my case.

**Example case: I want to get the output value of pooling layer.**

- `get_model()` function return a model for training
- `train_model()`
- `get_p_out()` function almost have the same code with `get_model()` except
	- the input parameters
	- the `Model()`'s output parameter
	- `set_weights()` from trained model
	- use the new model to predict value

### 2018-02-27 · Training using large dataset

**Problem description: Sometimes we need to use large dataset to train our model, but large dataset can't fit into memory.**

Reference: [For large datasets, which to use: fit or train_on_batch?](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/2708)

``` py
def generate_arrays_from_file(path):
    while 1:
        f = open(path)
        for line in f:
            # create numpy arrays of input data
            # and labels, from each line in the file
            x, y = process_line(line)
            img = load_images(x)
            yield (img, y)
        f.close()

model.fit_generator(generate_arrays_from_file('/my_file.txt'),
        samples_per_epoch=10000, nb_epoch=10)
```

`fit_generator`: The generator is run in parallel to the model, for efficiency. For instance, this allows you to do **real-time data augmentation** on images on CPU in parallel to training your model on GPU.

## Quick notes

### Metric

As of Keras 2.0, precision and recall were removed from the master branch. We need to implement them.

[issue #5400](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/5400) or [Removed batchwise metrics](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/commit/a56b1a55182acf061b1eb2e2c86b48193a0e88f7)

### Keras Syntax

The syntax shown below is very common used in Keras. We can use it in this way the usage of **Python's functional programming**.

``` py
from keras.layers import Input, Dense

inputs = Input(shape=(784,))
x = Dense(64, activation='relu')(inputs)
```

Take `keras.layers.merge.Concatenate` as example, the code behind may be like this.

``` py
def Concatenate(axis=-1):
    def afunc(x):
        return concatenate(x, axis=-1)
    return afunc
```

So `Concatenate(axis=-1)([a, b])` is equal with `concatenate([a, b], axis=-1)`.

Just guess, haven't checked the source code.

### Tensorboard

``` sh
from datetime import datetime
from keras.callbacks import TensorBoard

def get_log_path(key):
    name = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S")
    return './graphs/' + key + '-' + name

tensorboard = TensorBoard(log_dir=get_log_path('res_net'))
model.fit(..., callbacks=[tensorboard])
```
