## Pythagorean means

Pythagorean means （毕达哥拉斯的平均数） include:

- `arithmetic mean`
- `geometric mean`
- `harmonic mean`


### Arithmetic mean

The definition of arithmetic mean （算术平均数） is:

$$
AM = \frac1n (x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n)
$$

### Geometric mean

The definition of geometric mean （几何平均数） is:

$$
GM = \sqrt[n]{|x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdot \cdots \cdot x_n|}
$$

### Harmonic mean

The definition of harmonic mean (调和平均数) is:

<div>
$$
H = \frac{n}{\frac{1}{x_1} + \frac{1}{x_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{x_n}} = \frac{n}{\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{n} \frac{1}{x_i}}
$$
</div>

There are some [stories](https://www.zhihu.com/question/23096098) about harmonic mean. 

We must encounter this problem about average speed before.

>There are two docks A and B. <br/>
One boat go to A from B down the river, its speed is 30 km/h, <br/>
And this boat go back B from A, its speed is 20 km/h. <br/>
What is the average speed of this boat? 
>
The answer is the harmonic mean of 20 and 30, 24.

Another story:

>There is a couple, they both go to work by subway everyday.
But because the distance between their companies and home is different. <br/>
With the same money in card, husband spend them all with 20 days, and wife with 30 days. <br/>
For the convinence of recharge, they want to spend all the money simultaneously. <br/>
So in which days they exchange their cards can achieve this?

### Relationship

## Inequality

### Bernoulli's inequality

>**Bernoulli's Inequality**
>
Let \\(n=1,2,3,\cdots\\) Then for \\(x \gt -1\\),
$$
(1+x)^n \ge 1+nx
$$

*Proof.*

For \\(n=1\\),
$$(1+x)^1 = 1+x$$
which is true as required.

Now suppose the statement is true for \\(n=k\\), then <br/>
$$
(1+x)^k \ge 1+kx
$$

Because \\(x+1\gt0\\),
$$
\begin{align}
(1+x)^{k+1} & = (1+x)(1+x)^k \\\\\
& \ge (1+x)(1+kx)
\end{align}
$$

Then it follows that,
$$
\begin{align}
& (1+x)^{k+1} \ge (1+x)(1+kx) \\\\\
\implies & (1+x)^{k+1} \ge 1+ (k+1)x + kx^2 \\\\\
\implies & (1+x)^{k+1} \ge 1+ (k+1)x \\\\\
\end{align}
$$

By induction, it concludes the statement is true for all \\(n\ge1\\)
