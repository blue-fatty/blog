Course notes of CS231n, Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition.

## 2. Image Classification pipeline

- Challenges
    - Viewpoint variation 多视角
    - Illumination 光线
    - Deformation 变形
    - Occlusion 遮挡
    - Background Clutter 杂乱的背景
    - Intraclass variation 内类多样性
- Nearest Neighbor
    - Compute the distances of testing images and training images
    - \\(L_n\\) norm
        - \\((\sum_{i}{|X^i|^n})^{\frac{1}{n}}\\)
    - \\(L_n\\) distance
        - \\((\sum_{i}{|X_1^i - X_2^i|^n})^{\frac{1}{n}}\\)
    - method
        - For each testing image, find the nearest training image
        - Use the label of finding training image as the prediction
    - complexity
        - Training: \\(O(1)\\)
        - Testing: \\(O(n)\\)

<!--more-->

- K-Nearest Neighbor
    - Find k nearest t raining images to the testing image
    - Use the most voted label
    - **[K-Nearest Neighbors Demo](http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs231n-demos/knn/)**
    - Never used on images
        - very slow when testing
        - Distance metrics on pixels are not infomative
- Dataset spliting
    - train, test
    - train, validation, test
    - Cross-Validation
        - folds
        - each fold as validation and average the results
        - Useful for small datasets, but not used too frequently in deep learning
    - errorbar, violin plot https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html#statistics
- Linear Classifier
    - \\(f(\mathbf x, W) = W\\mathbf x+b\\)
    - have hard cases
        - xor
        - circles
