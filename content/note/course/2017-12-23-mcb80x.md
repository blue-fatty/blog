MCB80x is a free, open, online Neuroscience course from HarvardX led by Professor David Cox. Animation by Daniela Sherer + Music by Dan Deacon.  Edited by Alex Auriema.

## Welcome

- Harvard
- brain
- Three parts
    - explore science in Harvard and Boston
    - guided interactivity
    - DIY science
- Modules
    - THE ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF THE NEURON
        - signal generating, transfering
    - NEURONS AND NETWORKS
        - groups of neurons
    - THE BRAIN
        - society, intelligence
- Basics
    - 1.3 million named and catalogued species on earth, and scientists estimate there are over 7 million no
    - Why human distinct ?
        - human behavior, 30~300 thousand years ago, when our ancestor's brains began to structurally and functionally resemble our own
        - think symbolically
            - raise language, art, music, religion, philosophy, science
            - circumvent (规避) evolutionary and environment constraints
        - brain is the key
            - not size, whale, elephant, dolphin
            - but inner wiring
    - CNS, central nervous system
        - brain
        - spinal cord 脊髓
    - PNS, peripheral nervous system 周围神经系统
    - specialized cells
    - brain, made up of some 100 billion neurons, plus a myriad (无数的) of other cell types
    - Networks of neurons exchange information among dozens of brain areas specialized for different tasks
    - and researchers suspect that it is something about the organization and function of these networks that may hold the key to our uniquely human brain.
